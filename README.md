# Air New Zealand stock price forecasting based on Google Trend Index

Personally I have always been curious about the relation between Google search and stock price. This project was started from my curiosity. 

Methods:
The project chose one of Top 10 companies in New Zealand which is stongly related to the Internet or many customers have to use their services via Online. The information of Air New Zealand past stock prices collected from Yahoo Finance API, and Google Trend Index was from its website (https://trends.google.co.nz/trends). There was a limitation that Google Trend Index only provides weekly information when five years information needed. Therefore, this project trains a model using past five years information. (Later, this project will try to test using current daily information.)
